There is a small fraction of the world in need of smart wheelchairs, and among them there is a great range of functionality necessary. While a paraplegic may only want assistive steering and GPS, a quadriplegic may need an assistive robotic arm to help with their daily lives.  As any product which sufficiently caters to a certain disability would appeal to only a fraction of the already small target demographic, it is hard for companies to efficiently bring smart features to market. Our proposed solution provides open source, modular designs, in turn enabling greater accessibility and variety to the smart features wheelchair users need/desire.
