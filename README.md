According to the WHO, there are 65 million wheelchair users in the world, each with unique functional needs. Current products are often tailored to specific disabilities, making it challenging for companies to address the diverse demands within this niche market efficiently. Additionally, many smart wheelchairs are extremely expensive and difficult to understand and even operate. The purpose of the MOSS Chair is to create an open-source platform for smart wheelchairs. This platform will allow developers to implement modular designs, offering a continuously expanding range of features to cater to the varying needs of wheelchair users.

Our approach solves the user's problem by offering an open-source platform with modular designs. The wheelchair will initially feature assistive navigational functions, motorization for autonomous capabilities, computer vision algorithms like Inception-V2 for reliable and fast object detection, and compatibility with a programmable assistive robotic arm. This modular design allows developers to tailor features according to specific user needs, providing a customizable and adaptive solution. Additionally, our project involves community collaboration, which encourages a community of developers to contribute and innovate, expanding the range of available features over time. 

Each component chosen to solve this problem has its purpose. The decision to prioritize modularity and open-source principles is crucial in effectively addressing the various aspects of the customer's problem. Modularity ensures flexibility, allowing the wheelchair to adapt to varying user needs, while open-source principles encourage collaboration and innovation within the community. The chosen conceptual approach stems from the recognition that a rigid, closed-system approach would fall short in addressing the dynamic and diverse landscape of mobility challenges. By adopting a modular, open-source framework, we lay the groundwork for a solution that not only meets present needs but also invites ongoing collaboration, adaptation, and innovation to cater to emerging user requirements.

Our design implements the NVIDIA Jetson Nano as the control hub which handles signal processing for multiple different processes in the design. It utilizes PWM signals to control the Arduino Nano that communicates with the wheel’s motor encoders in order to move the wheelchair in the desired direction and speed. Additionally, the Jetson Nano has computer navigation, with images coming from the connected Raspberry Pi NoIR camera and LiDar sensor, which can be used in the future to move the wheelchair or arm autonomously. 
The Jetson Inference library that we used contained a pre-trained Inception-V2 model trained on Microsoft’s COCO dataset, which features multiple instances of common objects. We imported and trained this model on additional datasets and used it to detect objects in real-time from the Raspberry Pi SC0024 IMX219 NoIR Camera connected to the Jetson Nano. 

All in all, with the combination of sensors, robust motors and the powerful Jetson Nano, the MOSS Chair serves as a sustainable and accessible replacement for the traditional smart wheelchair. 


## Our Modules Thus Far
1. Motorization: we have three different motorization control modes, including key control (from a laptop), voice control, and a joystick.
2. Object Detection: through the Jetson Nano and connected camera, objects can be detected by the wheelchair.
3. Robotic Arm: a 3D-printed arm has been equipped with servo motors in the fingers and wrist area to allow for precise movement. This arm has high torque and is capable of picking up small items.


## Future Recommendations
1. Obstacle detection and avoidance: We have looked into ROS and LiDAR sensing for the wheelchair so that the wheelchair is able to drive autonomously. For future iterations of this project, we recommend looking into autonomous driving and control through LiDAR and ROS. This would be especially useful for indoor navigation as small objects would be avoided easily.
2. Eye movement/brain sensing: We recommend developing another control module for wheelchair motorization for users who have limited hand movement. We recommend looking into eye sensors and integrating these sensors with the motorization of the wheelchair so that users can move the wheelchair with their eyes. Another mode that could be looked into is sensing brain waves through EEG nodes or other sensors. By directly reading into the user's brain waves, the wheelchair would be able to be moved with minimal effort from the user. This would be more inclusive for users with hand mobility issues who may not be able to use our existing control modes like the keys or joystick.
3. Automatic weight tuning: As of now, the motor drivers are tuned manually based on the estimated weight of the wheelchair user. We recommend eventually integrating weight sensors into the seat of the wheelchair which can help automatically tune the motor drivers of the wheelchair to ensure smooth movement of the chair, regardless of user weight. As of right now, our wheelchair is ideal for users up to 180 pounds. By integrating weight sensors, the motor drivers can be tuned to higher levels to help accommodate for potential users heavier than 180 pounds.
4. Integrating object detection with the robotic arm: by integrating object detection with the arm, the arm will be able to move as per the user's desires. We envision the arm being able to push elevator buttons, open and close doors, and pick up small items. So far, we have the object detection working independently of the arm. Additionally, we have the arm 3D-printed out and equipped with high-torque servo motors. These two modules should be integrated together to create a high-level and more user-friendly module capable of completing essential tasks that may be impossible for people with arm mobility issues.

## Things to Look Out For
1. Loose wires! Make sure that all wires are always fully connected. Even one loose wire can lead to erratic motor movement.
2. Battery charging: As of right now, we are using 2 24 V AGM batteries connected in parallel. These batteries get drained after extraneous work and need to be charged regularly.
3. Encoders: Make sure encoders are always connected to the spokes well to make sure that the motors can actually move the wheelchair.
4. Arm strings: Make sure the strings connected to the fingers of the arm are taut at all points. If the strings get loose, the arm will not be able to move as smoothly or strongly as envisioned.
