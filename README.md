# mosschair.github.io

MOSSChair is dedicated to creating smart modules that can be added to a manual wheelchair so that users can make a customized wheelchair based on the wheelchair user's unique needs. So far, we have created the following modules that are controlled through code found in the code folder under our main branch. This code is put onto an NVIDIA Jetson Nano and mounted onto a manual wheelchair. 

## Our modules
1. Motorization: we have three different motorization control modes, including key control (from a laptop), voice control, and a joystick.
2. Object Detection: through the Jetson Nano and connected camera, objects are able to be detected by the wheelchair.
3. Robotic Arm: a 3D printed arm has been equipped with servo motors in the fingers and wrist area to allow for precise movement. This arm has high torque and is capable of picking up small items.
